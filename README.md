# Zomato Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Zomato dataset to uncover insights related to restaurant ratings, locations, and cuisine trends. As a beginner, this project helped me understand the data and prepare it for further analysis or predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

The Zomato dataset provides information about restaurants, including their locations, cuisines, and customer ratings. The main goals of this project are:
- Explore the dataset to identify key patterns.
- Visualize important features like restaurant ratings, popular cuisines, and city-wise distributions.
- Extract meaningful insights for better decision-making.

### Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and filtered the dataset to remove irrelevant or missing values.
   - Extracted specific columns like `Restaurant Name`, `City`, `Cuisines`, and `Rating`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized data using bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to show the distribution of restaurants across cities and their corresponding ratings.
   - Analyzed the most popular cuisines across different cities.
   - Investigated which cities had the highest number of top-rated restaurants.

3. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Focused on identifying cuisines that contribute to high ratings.
   - Created visual representations of data to find meaningful patterns.

### Next Steps
I plan to use this analysis as a foundation for building predictive models or making data-driven recommendations for improving restaurant performance.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YashsTiwari/EDA-Zomato-dataset.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook to view the EDA.
